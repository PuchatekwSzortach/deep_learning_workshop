# simple_\_neural_\_network

A basic implementation of a neural network.
Two files are provided:
- net.py - contains definition of a simple neural network class
- mnist.py - a simple examply of a network trained on mnist dataset

This code is inspired by textbook "Neural networks and Deep Learning" by Michael A. Nielsen, and its accompanying code samples.

You can install most dependencies with conda using `conda env create -f environment.yml`. 
One caveat is `visual-logging` library - its pip version is out of date, so it's best to install it directly from github with `pip install git+https://github.com/dchaplinsky/visual-logging`.
